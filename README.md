# Google Forms to Discord, made by Iku and improved by RooRay among others

This fork of the Google Forms to Discord GitHub repository adds some features from pull requests (notably removing whitespace and adding timestamps), this also incorporates proper titles and footers.

# Installation

The installation for this fork is the exact same as the [official installation](https://github.com/Iku/Google-Forms-to-Discord) just replace the code used there with my modified `google script.js` file. Support for this will not be provided by me outside of code-related issues and small help with setup.
